##Intro##
This is the openQCM Java software v0.2. The repository is designed  for the contributors community of the open source project. 
The basic software is written in Java programming language, as the Arduino IDE itself. 
It can communicate to the serial port via the RXTX library, refer to [Arduino Playground](http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Java) for more info about Arduino and Java interfacing. 

OpenQCM software uses [Ardulink](http://www.ardulink.org/), the open source Java solution for the control and coordination of Arduino boards
